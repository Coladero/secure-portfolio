# 🖥️ Secure Portfolio — Terminal-style Developer Portfolio

A unique, terminal-inspired portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to showcase my work and growth as a junior web developer.  
This project aims to simulate a Bash-like terminal where users can explore my background, projects, and skills through typed commands.

> ⚠️ This is a work in progress. I'm currently refactoring the logic, structure, and design to follow best practices, improve accessibility, and ensure a responsive UI.

## 🚧 What’s next

- Refactor command logic into a modular structure ✅
- Improve keyboard accessibility ⌨️
- Enhance mobile experience 📱
- Add typing animation and error handling 👨‍💻
- Integrate a dynamic "projects" command using GitHub API 🔗

Follow the commit history to see the evolution of this portfolio step by step.
